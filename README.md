# An API Gateway API for AWS Lambda Function
Pass 2 nubembers as query string parameters and return Addtion, Multiplication, Subtraction, and Division.


## The pupose of this application
To learn how to use AWS API Gateway and Lambda Function, I made a simple function.

### How it works
For example, if you pass URL...?numone=2&numtwo=10
It shows the following<br/>
"Display the result of four arithmetric operations. Original numbers are 2, 10. Addtion: 12, Multiplication: 20, Subtraction: 8, Division: 0.2. "

The boddymapping.txt describes how I set a template for query string parameters.

### What I used
Javascript, API Gateway, AWS Lambda Function
